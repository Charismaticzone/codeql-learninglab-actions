## Updating and Releasing

### :whale: `codeql-learninglab-check` docker image

The top-level dependency is the
[`codeql-learninglab-check`](codeql-learninglab-check) docker image.
To update its dependencies,
or release a new version of it,
please see [the README for that docker image](codeql-learninglab-check).

### Courses included in the `courses/` directory

Following changes to the [`codeql-learninglab-check`](codeql-learninglab-check)
base docker image,
you'll likely want to update each of the individual courses to use the latest
version.
(This will be necessary for users to take advantage of the latest changes to
the CodeQL libraries or tools).
You can do this by updating the `FROM` line in the respective `Dockerfile`.

Changes to the courses,
including changes to the `Dockerfile`,
the configuration,
or any of the expected results `.csv` files are automatically published when
pushes are made to `master`.
This is done by the respective `publish.sh` file for each course.

We generally want to ensure that we always push the version `latest` so that
changes can immediately be used by all course participants,
and we don't need to update any references to versions elsewhere.
